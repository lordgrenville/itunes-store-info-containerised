# Home assignment for Peer39
This repo is forked from the DMI's [iTunes Store Scaper](https://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/itunes-app-scraper), a simple Python scraper.

Although this repo includes a search for the top 100 apps (in this case, searching for the first 100 apps in the `TOP_FREE_IOS` collection), the results that this returns don't appear to be sorted correctly (namely, we want a descending search in order of ratings, this returns a lot of apps that provide homescreen widgets, it might be newest? Possibly because it uses the Old Affiliates API) Therefore I used a third-party analytics service (`appfigures.com`) to get the top 100, then used the DMI's scraper to get the app details (via scraping the iTunes Store), and used Pandas and some basic heuristics to complete the assignment.
